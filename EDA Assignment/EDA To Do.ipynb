    "- **Team Strength:** Understand which teams typically win by large margins and whether certain teams are known for close wins or dominating their opponents.\n",
    "- **Target Runs vs. Result Margin:** Explore whether teams chasing a large target tend to win by large margins or if close wins are more common.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Player of the Match and Individual Performance**\n",

    "#### **Key Use Case:**\n",
    "- **Identify patterns in player performance that influence match outcomes.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Insights:**\n",
    "- **Most Frequent \"Player of the Match\":** Identify the players who frequently win the \"Player of the Match\" award. Which players consistently contribute to match-winning performances?\n",
    "- **Impact of Batting and Bowling Performances:** Analyze the types of performances that win \"Player of the Match\" awards. Do match-winning performances typically come from high-scoring batsmen or wicket-taking bowlers?\n",
    "- **Player Contribution Correlation:** Assess whether certain players’ performances (batting or bowling) are more likely to lead to team victories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Team Performance Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Use Case:**\n",
    "- **Compare teams based on their overall performance in various seasons, cities, and venues.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Insights:**\n",
    "- **Winning Team Comparison:** Compare the number of matches won by each team across all seasons. Which teams have the highest winning percentage? Are some teams more successful in specific seasons?\n",
    "- **Home vs. Away Performance:** Investigate if certain teams perform better when playing at home (in their home cities/venues) compared to when they play away.\n",
    "- **Consistency:** Identify teams that show consistency across different seasons and those that experience fluctuating performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Method of Result Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Use Case:**\n",
    "- **Understand how various methods (e.g., DLS) are applied in rain-affected or interrupted matches.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Insights:**\n",
    "- **Impact of DLS Method:** Analyze how the DLS (Duckworth-Lewis-Stern) method affects the outcome of rain-affected matches. Does it favor one team over another? \n",
    "- **Frequency of Rain Interruptions:** Check how often the method was applied and how it impacted match results, particularly in tournaments with frequent rain interruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Umpire Influence**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Use Case:**\n",
    "- **Examine the role of umpires in match outcomes.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Insights:**\n",
    "- **Umpire Distribution:** Investigate how often each umpire officiated in matches and whether there is any trend associated with the outcome of matches officiated by specific umpires.\n",
    "- **Umpire Pairing Impact:** Compare results based on umpire pairings (Umpire1 and Umpire2). Does the pairing of certain umpires correlate with higher or lower match outcomes for particular teams?\n",
